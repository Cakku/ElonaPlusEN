In times long past, the land of Irva has seen ten great civilizations,
the ruins of which still dot the land. The scars left by the previous
civilization, Rehm-Ido, have yet to heal. This is a story of Sierre Terre,
the 11th era, said to be the most destructive and yet most revitalizing of them all.

{txt}
A month of rain plagued the frontier lands of Karune, and once it cleared,
the Vindale Forest began to change. The Forest rapidly spread its roots,
and began emanating a strange fog which created an environment
uninhabitable by people.
 
The Vindale Forest quickly overtook the land of the people of Karune,
and refugees poured into North Tyris.
 
A prince from Zanan, one of the Western countries, preaches that
this phenomenon is the very same calamity that befell Rehm-Ido
and advocates for the destruction of both the Heretical Forest
and the Elean people.
 
The Elea of Vindale began to retreat from human lands to avoid persecution,
but the world's animosity towards them is still afire. The flames of war threaten
to ignite at any moment.

{txt}
The dawn will soon arrive. You had slipped in with the cargo of the merchant
ship Queen Sedona which was headed for North Tyris.  Suddenly you are
awakened by a thundering roar.
 
The air is alight with the sound of splitting wood as violent waves crash
into the ship and terrible winds assault the sails. An old sailor curses his
god and mutters:
 
 "It's the Etherwind"
 
...The wood of the ship gives a final moan as the violent waves crush the hull.
Without even time for her passengers to say a final prayer, the Queen Sedona
is swallowed by the sea.

A soldier bearing the crest of Zanan hails you as you enter the town of Vernis.
 
After a round of careful questioning, the Zanan soldier that had regarded you
with suspicion informs you that the Crown Prince of Zanan is in the town on
campaign.
 
You notice that a crowd is gathered in the village square, listening intently to
the albino prince that leans weakly against his attendant.
 
{mc}	"mcUnrest2"
{chat_1}
...And so I am overcome with grief. Zanan has lost the war with the new Kingdoms, and without its leader, shall become host to the conflict between the two great nations for many years to come. Even if the late Prince Clyne were still alive and was to make a bid for peace, the war between these nations would not be silenced.

{chat_1}
War... Can not these nations who wish to stain themselves with blood and flame recognize that an unimaginable crisis has befallen Sierre Terre? These evil winds spoil our forests, take the lives of our countrymen, and rob us of our lands. The Elea and their Heretical Forest plan to revive the Meshera, the nightmares that destroyed the civilization of Rehm-Ido.

{chat_1}
Now is the time for unity - a great trial has been thrust upon Irva, and if we put aside our petty squabbles and learn to understand one another, we can destroy the Heretics and their Forest. Together we can overcome this catastrophe.

{chat_1}
Zanan is no longer the superpower that it once was. But hear me, my friends: we are not powerless. Palmia, which has heretofore withstood the power of the two great nations and has the faith and determination of its people, is the hope of Sierre Terre.

{txt}
A great cheer rose from the square.
 
The speaker's voice was drowned out by the sound, no longer reaching your
ears where you stood at the back of the crowd.
 
You leave the square slowly, remembering the albino prince with a strange sense
of both unease and interest.

- At the bar in Vernis -

{txt}
With the clinking cups of the Zanan soldiers, the bar in Vernis had at long last
regained its liveliness.
 
A young soldier, overwhelmed with liquor and drunk with his own sense of power, 
fabricated some pretext to begin a fight with a seedy-looking patron, occasionally
yelling and striking the man with his fists.
 
A red-haired official, noticing the commotion that his subordinate was causing, 
drained his tankard of crim ale and stood up calmly.
 
{chat_1}
What's going on here?

{chat_2}
Oh, captain. Ain't nothing serious. Just questioning this suspicious looking man here. With the Prince in the area, a guard can't just overlook suspicious people even while at the bar! ...Hey, you. Are you listening?

{chat_1}
This man is...

{chat_2}
Yeah, as you can see, he's not much for manners. I'll just rough him up a bit more and then send him away. I couldn't possibly enjoy my drink now if I don't cause him at least some pain.

Stop.

{chat_2}
C'mon Captain. If I break one of his legs, it'll just give the beggar an easier time.

You've changed. The White Hawk of Zanan, given the privileges of an aristocrat, whose talent was envied and whose deeds were praised by all, now sits in the corner of a rundown bar, gazing at the world with the eyes of a dead man. It was troubling, you know, to no longer have anyone to compete with once you left Zanan.

Heh, not even a single response to all of that. When you're bored of this little act, do you ever think back to what you told me back then?

{chat_1}
You've been stripped of your fame and wealth and look like nothing more than a common beggar. What an unimaginable joke you are now compared to what you once were. Did you decide, perhaps, to cast off your desires and live the life of a sinner as a memorial to that girl?

Lord Saimore, we've arrested a strange man in the city tavern. According to Sir Loyter, he's the <White Hawk> that disappeared three years ago.

Are you certain?

{chat_3}
Hah, well... There is a passing resemblance, but his appearance is drastically different and he has refused to answer any of our questions. I would say it's a different person myself, but if Sir Loyter says it's him, then I trust his judgment.

{chat_1}
Changed, has he? Fufu... Of course he has. It's impossible that he'd be the same as he was before. Let him be. Do not harm him.

How ironic. We searched for you ever since the time you left Zanan, and yet only now that things have progressed so far do we finally find you.

{chat_1}
It's wonderful to see you again, Larnneire. You have grown from a naughty little child into a splendid woman since last we met. I'm sure your journey here must have been harsh, given the circumstances.

{chat_2}
It's been a long time, Your Majesty. Thanks to your influence, we were able to arrive here without incident. At this time, as a messenger from the Forest, and for the sake of both the Elea and all of Sierre Terre, I would like to request that Palmia lend the Elea its strength in dealing with the Heretical Forest.
	
{chat_1}
...Larnneire, I am truly sorry, but I'm afraid that I cannot lend you that aid that you seek. I too am pained by the tragedy befalling the Elea, but as I'm sure you're aware, the most Palmia can do is seek to keep a balance between the Yerles and the Eulderna.

{chat_1}
The Prince of Zanan has already gathered significant support from various nations and their peoples, and they have found a common enemy in the Heretical Forest. If Palmia were to speak against this now, not only would Zanan treat us as rebels, but the two great nations would as well. If Palmia were to fall, there would no longer be any barrier against a war between the two great nations. I simply cannot condemn Sierre Terre to another great war.

{chat_2}
...Is your intent then for the Elea to be the sacrificial lambs on the altar of peace between the two great nations? Our country was only established because the blood of innocent Elea was being shed in foreign nations. What peace we have had has been short and fragile. Is there no longer anyone on this continent with the heart to reach out to the weak?

{chat_3}
...If they committed no sin, then their fate is truly regrettable. Yet, surely you're aware of what your Heretical Forest and its Etherwind have wrought upon the world?

{chat_2}
So you've come, Lord Barius? Certainly it is undeniable that strange events have been occurring in the Forest due to the Etherwind. But for what reason would the Vindale Forest, which has posed no problems for all of Sierre Terre, suddenly act up now? Is it not prejudice to lay blame at the feet of the Elea without first investigating?

{chat_2}
Your Majesty, please heed my words. The issue of the Etherwind and the Forest is not related to the calamity that they speak of. If the claims that the Prince of Zanan makes are wrong...

{chat_1}
Speak no further, Larnneire.

{chat_2}
But Your Majesty, the truth...

{chat_1}
I said that's enough. I'll hear the rest of what you have to say tomorrow. I will have arrangements made for you and your companion to stay tonight at the inn. Now is... not the time for us to continue. Please understand.

How embarrassing. Don't believe the girl's lies, King Xabi.

{chat_4}
I began investigating this disaster at a young age. The "Meshera" are also known as the "World Devouring Giants". Is the Heretical Forest, whose roots spread and eat away our lands, not exactly that? Even were her claims that the Forest and the Meshera are unrelated to be true, it is undeniable that the Forest is consuming our land and producing terrible monsters. King Xabi, I must insist that you entrust that girl to my care.

{chat_1}
Hmm. Could that be because what Larnneire speaks is the truth?

{chat_4}
What I have told you is the truth. I have my own interests in that girl. More importantly, King Xabi, have you forgotten that Palmia's existence is reliant upon Zanan?

{chat_1}
Larnneire is an important guest. Even if the request is coming from the Prince of Zanan himself, I cannot hand her over. Palmia will forsake all involvement with the issue of the Vindale Forest. Is that not enough to satisfy you? You must excuse me for now. I have other business that must be attended to.

{wait}

...Fufu, she escaped. Still, I was surprised. Is she not the spitting image of her?

First the White Hawk, and now her. At last the wheels of destiny have begun to turn.

While I don't believe in fate, this lively stage that has been set has exceeded my expectations. I welcome it. We must prepare a suitable role for them. I have faith in your abilities, Barius The Blue-Haired.

Any request for a price, is it? ...Fufu. Well, I certainly know someone who is skilled enough to help you, regardless of what danger it is you find yourself in. But for that man, it comes down to whether he feels like it or not, not a price. Yes, I am Liana. Both of you, come with me.

Now, now... there's no need to be in such a rush. Don't mind them, Bethel. These people don't know the terrible things that you've been through. When I first saw your haunted eyes, I knew.

No, never mind. Tell me about your request.

I see. You did well to rely on me. The ones pursuing you are from Zanan... Saimore, to be precise. Heh, there's no need to have anyone investigate that.

My apologies. As you've no doubt surmised, I was visited by another guest before your arrival. While I'm sure you're tired from your long trip from Palmia, Larnneire, I'll have to ask that you accompany him. Though, it's not really a choice. The palace is already surrounded.

No need to be so tense, Elea. I have no intention of harming you. I simply wish for a conversational partner. Someone to talk to about myself.

Someone to talk to? Don't expect for us to reach some sort of understanding. You're slyly manipulating the public opinion in order to call for the destruction of the Vindale Forest. Until you can provide some evidence that the issue of the Forest and the Etherwind are the cause of the calamity of which you speak, the Elea will never believe you.

{chat_1}
There's no need for you to believe me. In fact, my story is a lie. Rather than being the cause of the calamity, the Vindale Forest is an antidote of sorts. It senses the revival of the Meshera and is releasing an antibody which we know as Ether.

{chat_3}
...What are you saying?

{chat_1}
Fufu, got your attention now, do I? But I'm afraid you'll have to listen to my tale before I inform you of the truth of the Forest.

{chat_3}
...

{mc}	"mcMemory2"
{wait}

{chat_1}
This story is from long ago. There were once two princes in Zanan. One was a frail and ugly albino, while the other was his handsome and vigorous brother Clyne. The name of the first, I think, need not be mentioned. The two princes were as different as light and shadow. The warlike Clyne was naturally successful, while his brother who lived in his shadow was a failure.

{chat_1}
Unlike his brother, the younger boy despised conflict, instead preferring song and poem. He was a pacifist and did much to help the disadvantaged and those that were orphaned by the war. Among these, he took a particular interest in the "Heretical" Elea and their Forest. While Clyne amused himself with hunting and socializing, the younger boy devoted himself to studying the Forest. Hope, after all, is something born of ignorance. Perhaps it was that he saw something of himself in the Heretical Forest. By eliminating the prejudice and suspicion regarding the Forest, and by exploring a path of coexistence with the Elea, he believed the world might change...

{chat_1}
And yet years passed while his research made little progress. Fufu, the boy simply could not come to terms with the life of an adult. He couldn't accept that the world was at its core an unkind and unfair place where the strong rule over the weak. He began to begrudge his brother who continuously rose in power, all the while cursing himself for being born an albino and hating the world that refused to change its ways... And then, he met an angel.

{chat_1}
She was an Elean girl roughly his own age. From the moment he saw her he was fascinated with her. Her chestnut eyes were strong, gentle, and overflowing with compassion. As he watched her live a strong life in Zanan which is notoriously cruel to her kind, he once again saw a part of himself in the Elea.

{chat_1}
For the boy, she was... No, I think that's a story for another time... Suffice it to say that her passing left nothing but a gaping wound upon the boy's heart. Even now I am pained by my memories of that time... Let's continue this later. There is more than enough time to discuss everything.

Hoh, so you came without your subordinates. Don't expect me to forget that you're our "lifeline" with Zanan though.

Zanan itself has nothing to do with all of this. The girl's confinement is a direct order from Saimore. From what I understand though, he's ready to release her at any time.

{chat_4}
And what does Saimore want in return?

{chat_1}
Very soon the leaders from various countries will be gathering in Palmia for discussion. His request is that she attend as a representative of the Elea.

{chat_1}
I'm sure you've heard about the funeral of the late Prince Clyne, yes? 'Twas a grand affair, after all. Yet, few people are aware that there was no corpse within his coffin. The world was told that Clyne's death was a result of falling off a cliff while out on a ride... But that's not the truth. Would you care to take a guess at what is? Clyne was murdered. Murdered by that albino boy that everyone despised.

{chat_1}
As Clyne took in the view from the mountainside, his brother pushed him off the cliff. And when he made that push, something within him died as well. Having struggled his entire life to not be a burden on others, it was the first time the boy felt powerful and free. And yet in that moment, in his lust to deny and overturn the values of his brother whom the world viewed as a success, he abandoned himself. His pacifism, his compassion for the poor, his affection for the weak, all of the morals he touted - he betrayed them all and became nothing more than a tool for the power he had despised all his life.

{chat_1}
And even after becoming the successor to Zanan, he was unable to move forward. Oh, he could exercise his power and become a second Clyne if he so wished. But could he truly deny everything he once was? His past self that was so ugly and weak? Could he honestly turn his head, pretending that the pain and conflict that he and others had experienced each and every day did not exist? It was the very means by which I affirmed myself that also took away my ability to accept the world. Morals, values, emotions... What had I left to believe in? But don't misunderstand. I am not attempting to garner your sympathy by making it appear that I am unhappy or feel regret.

{chat_3}
Why tell me your story, then? To be honest, the choices you have defined for yourself appear as simple deception to me. Could that boy from the past who preached compassion towards the weak truly accept becoming such an ugly person as you are now? I won't say that I don't understand your pain. But having been rejected by the world - No, I should say having turned your back on it - and running from a life you felt incomplete, wishing nothing but pain and hatred upon yourself... I can't help but wonder if you're using these things to fill the emptiness in your heart.

{chat_3}
You say you had nothing left to believe in, but I feel that potential still lies within your heart. I think you have decided that some things are undeserving of love, and that you yourself are one of them. But I think that relationships can be built with methods other than hatred and insincerity.

{chat_1}
...How surprising. It is once again a young Elean girl that offers me the light known as hope as I drown within the darkness of my despair. But I'm afraid that the time where that may have been useful has passed. If nothing else, I now understand that if such a thing as goodwill existed within this world that there may have yet been another path for me. For that, at least, I am grateful.

{chat_1}
...Ah yes, I promised to tell you the secret of the Forest, didn't I? As you thought, the Etherwind and the Forest's expansion are not the calamity known as the "Meshera". Meshera is... a bacteria, so to speak, that devours all life. It all but perished once during the era of Rehm-Ido, but has risen again with the advent of Sierre Terre. Or perhaps I should say that Sierre Terre is Meshera itself. The World-Devouring Giants live within me, within you, within all living creatures.

{chat_3}
But... If that's the case, if we're all infected by the Meshera, how are we alive?

{chat_1}
I can't spoil the fun by giving everything away, now can I? I'll answer your question as strictly as I can. The reason that we can exist is due to the Heretical Forest. Were the Forest to be destroyed, all life on Irva would disappear, though whether it would take a single year or a hundred I cannot say. Fufu. "Heretical Forest" is such an ironic name. It is we who are the true heretics of this world.

{chat_1}
Now it's only a matter of time before the Vindale Forest is destroyed by human hands. When everything that the people of the world believe in collapses, when they learn the truth too late to reverse their actions, what do you think will become of the world? I, for one, am looking forward to finding out.

{chat_3}
This is absurd. While I could sympathize with your background, how could you escalate a personal issue to one of life and death for the entire world?

{chat_1}
Ah, but is it not that absurdity that makes it enjoyable? If you would prefer to discuss philosophy, speak with Barius instead. His own motivations differ from my own... But this conversation is at an end. Rest well, Witch of the Heretical Forest. I have an amusing scenario planned for you tomorrow.

No... King Xabi...

We haven't been surrounded just yet. We can still escape.

It's no use. We can't enter Vernis. The city is already abuzz with rumors about a Witch from the Heretical Forest using wicked magic to murder the king of Palmia for refusing to support Vindale.

{chat_1}
Saimore's aim is clear. By making us public enemies, he will drive us to the Heretical Forest and use that as an excuse for war.

{chat_3}
War, is it? The Elean people have neither the weapons nor stupidity required for such a thing. But if even avoiding conflict and secluding ourselves within the Forest leads to such distrust, what else is left to us?

{chat_2}
Even if that's what Saimore plans, we still must go to the Forest to warn everyone. But I think we should make another stop first. Saimore told me to seek his research institute if I wanted to know more about the secrets of the Forest.

{chat_3}
And you intend to just do what he says?

{chat_2}
He claimed that the Vindale Forest is keeping the Meshera in check. Obtaining evidence of that might just be the only hope we have left. And... I don't know quite how to say it, but I feel like he's waiting. He's waiting to see what path we will choose.

Then we head for Zanan. Been a long time hasn't it, Bethel?

I can't seem to fall asleep. Just what is it you're looking for out there?

Oh, Sevilis... I'm just thinking about the people Lomias and I left at the Forest. We left shouldering everyone's expectations. I was looking forward to seeing their smiling faces when we returned, but... This journey has become so long and painful. I'm truly sorry we got you involved in this. And I'm grateful you prepared this ship for us.

{chat_1}
There's no need to thank me. I have my own grudge against Zanan. I'm here of my own free will... And Bethel, too, has his own reasons for coming.

{chat_2}
You seem to know him... Bethel is a good man, I think. He seemed difficult to approach at first, but he has risked his life to protect us, and given us encouragement through our hardships. Even Lomias of all people has changed how he feels about him. But that smile he wears seems sad for some reason. It makes it seem... Like he's given up. Sometimes it feels like he's wearing a mask to hide his heart from other people.

{chat_1}
Some people don't mesh well with this world. Yes, he has his own problems, and he knows better than anyone else that he's the only one who can deal with them. But he can't bring himself to seek the sympathy and consolation of others. Some people will cling to and fight for any glimmer of hope that shows itself, while others will surrender and wallow in darkness. Which Bethel will choose, I cannot say.

Standing there like that... You remind me of Elishe.

{chat_2}
You've mentioned her before. Is she someone important to you?

{wait}

{chat_1}
Like you, she was an Elea from Vindale. While we weren't blood related, we loved and supported one another like family while we lived in the port city of Altiheit in Zanan... I should stop. I'm sure this is boring for you.

{chat_2}
No, please continue. I'd like to hear about it.

{wait}

{chat_1}
...At the time, the war between the Yerles and the Eulderna was in full force, and many people got caught in the middle. I was still young, and the war had left me with nothing but disappointment and a feeling of emptiness. All I cared about was getting away from my home town, so I slipped aboard a ship carrying war orphans to Altiheit. It was there, in Altiheit, that I met Elishe.

{chat_1}
They looked at her with nothing but contempt, and their words towards her were nothing but abuse. They blamed her for an illness that had been spreading throughout the ship, and consequently, no orphanage would take her in. But Elishe stood strong and endured their abuse and contempt, as if that kind of treatment was normal for her. Before I even realized what I was doing, I was standing in front of her and holding her hand.

{chat_1}
Scrounging up enough to eat isn't easy for two children living alone in an unfamiliar city. But we took shelter in one of the port warehouses, and by working, managed to stave off hunger. While I worked for her sake, I found that my disappointment slowly began to fade. And then... Something strange happened.

{chat_1}
A leather bag began to be placed in the window of the warehouse every morning on the day of worship. Inside was hard bread and good cheese, a few gold coins, and occasionally even medicine or clothing. Someone was lending us a helping hand from the shadows. I once asked the man who brought the bag about it, but he dodged my question by saying it was from "The Angel of Altiheit".

{chat_1}
Whether that man was the "angel" himself or simply a courier, I never found out. But I'm sure whoever it was noticed that it wasn't just bread or coin that bag brought us, but hope. Elishe and I clung to that faint light of hope and used it to weather our difficulties in Altiheit...

{chat_1}
Before I left for Altiheit, I was enrolled in a military academy called Ateran, a place for those who are exceptionally gifted to sharpen their talents even further. For the kind of people at Ateran, power is everything. To them, everyone else is an enemy, nothing more than tools to be used in order to get ahead. They show no hesitation in using the weak as stepping stones... And I was no different. Knowingly or not, whether they resisted or not, I harmed many people. I was an arrogant and ruthless man.

{chat_1}
One day I came down with a terrible illness and had to leave Ateran. Through the attentive care of my younger brother, my only remaining relative, I narrowly survived. But when I rejoined the world after two months of recovery, it seemed like an entirely different place.

{chat_1}
Suddenly, when others looked at me, it was if I could feel their malice and contempt. Even in the eyes of children, a person like me who had left Ateran was nothing but a piece of trash... Of course, they didn't actually feel that way. I was terrorizing myself by projecting my own way of thinking onto others. It wasn't until that moment that I realized just how ugly and totally devoid of humanity I was.

{chat_1}
...I tried to change myself. But regardless of any efforts I made to find inner pieace, even when I otherwise kept myself engaged, the part of me that had been trained in Ateran sneered at how pathetic I was, tempting me to return. Even now I doubt I've fully separated myself from the values that place instilled in me. I fought that side of myself for many years, and in the end, I had nothing but a feeling of emptiness and a desire to erase everything about myself. That's why I left home.

{chat_1}
Elishe was different from any person I had ever met. She was not a beautiful woman as you are, but her eyes... They saw everything as it truly was, and forgave it. Accepted it... You have those eyes as well. The years I spent together with her in Altiheit will forever occupy a large place in my heart. Elishe was my reason to live, in every sense of the phrase.

{chat_1}
In order to protect her, in order to make her happy, I was able to accept my past self. By telling myself it was for her, I was capable of using others as tools and doing terrible things to guarantee success. My internal struggle had been entrusted to Elishe. And, after more than seven years in Altiheit, I had become a top officer in Zanan...

On that day... It was a cool Autumn night. I had gone to see a play together with Elishe. It was mediocre in every sense, but I can still remember it even now. There's nothing about that day I can forget.

{chat_1}
As we made our way home from the play, smoke and screams arose from a nearby mansion. We rushed over as quickly as we could, and when we arrived, the flames were still low. We immediately set about rescuing people. Elishe refused to stop until she could be certain nobody was left inside, until no more voices were crying out. And... A part of the exit-way suddenly collapsed on her...

{chat_1}
I immediately rushed to her and attempted to lift the beam off of her, but it was impossible for me to do by myself. I turned to seek help from those around us, but my pleas were met only by the scared and cruel gazes of the onlookers. They were going to leave the young Elean girl who had been their savior to die. But what right had I to fault them? If a rival had needed my help, my reaction would have been the same as theirs... Before long, the flames had engulfed everything.

{chat_1}
I buried my head into the ground until dawn came. When I came across Elishe's bones when searching that charred rubble, I cried for the first time... And time has been frozen for me ever since.

{chat_5}
How much do you know about the civilization of Rehm-Ido? Rehm-Ido overcame the materialism that had plagued Eyth Terre, and even after 300 years was considered to be the greatest civilization of the world. All across the nation various communities were joined by the idea of mutual cooperation with each other and harmony with nature.

{chat_5}
Yet among these communities was a group that differed from the others, known as the Yutasu. Rather than being a close-knit community, "Yutasu" was simply a generic term for those who lacked the ability to fit in with the other communities. Those who couldn't form close bonds with others, those with abnormal desires, those who preferred solitude, those without morals, materialists... Anyone who didn't fit in with the other communities was named Yutasu, and while it wasn't visible on the surface, they were detested by society.

{chat_5}
The substance that we know as Ether was discovered by accident near the end of Rehm-Ido. Rehm-Ido had highly advanced biochemistry, and Ether proved to be a valuable resource that provided a chemical change to a variety of medicines. And perhaps most importantly, Ether could be harvested from trees and was environment-friendly, a perfect fit for the ideology of Rehm-Ido.

{chat_5}
With the discovery of Ether came a great change in the position of Yutasu in society. The process of Ether collection was called "Star Harvesting" and considered sacred... And the Yutasu were the greatest land holders. Through the process of "Star Harvesting", the Yutasu regained their injured self-esteem and found their place in the society of Rehm-Ido. It was for this reason that, despite knowing it was coming, they averted their eyes from the creeping threat of the Meshera...

{chat_5}
How the Meshera came to be remains a mystery. What is known is that it was Ether that was responsible for the immune system of the forests. With the rampant collection of Ether, the forests were left easy prey for the Meshera. Because the Yutasu were afraid of losing their status they had gained as Ether collectors, by the time the rest of the world noticed what was happening, it was too late to do anything.

{chat_5}
Meshera "devoured" the forest and gradually spread, and where they spread, they created an environment where no other life on Irva could survive. The civilization of Rehm-Ido was slowly slipping towards its death.

{chat_5}
It was only the far east, where untouched forests still covered the land, that withstood the advance of the Meshera. The people gave the Forest the name of "Vindale", meaning hope... And after many years, after the vast knowledge and culture of the previous human civilization had been lost, the Vindale Forest lived up to its name.

{chat_5}
A massive immune reaction arose from the Forest, becoming a wind that raged across the world. Indeed, this is what we now know as the Etherwind. The Etherwind enhanced the natural immunity of the plant life that had been infected by the Meshera, massively weakening the Meshera infection. The Vindale Forest which produced the Etherwind and the outside world where the Meshera had been weakened slowly began to differ from one another. That is the environment present in Irva now.

{chat_5}
With the arrival of the miracle of Vindale, the civilization of Rehm-Ido came to an end, and the era of Sierre Terre began... But humanity had painful times in their future. As time passed, some were born who could adapt to life outside of the Forest, and eventually, some who were born who were only capable of living outside the Forest. How that would turn out, you should well know.

{chat_5}
...That is the truth of the Forest. Should the Vindale Forest ever be destroyed, the Etherwind will cease. Eventually the Meshera would spread across all of Irva, leaving it a place unsuitable for life.

{chat_3}
So now we understand the truth of the Forest. And yet, now another question is even more difficult to grasp. What the hell is the meaning behind doing this? I could understand if the motive was revenge against those who had abused the Elea, but what point would such an action have if all life perishes as a result?

{chat_5}
It is not revenge. It is both a punishment and a chance. Besides, life will not perish. Salvation is already within our grasp.

{chat_5}
I believe Rehm-Ido to be the ideal civilization. Yet, something as weak as fellowship isn't enough to keep the Yutasu in check. In order to overcome the Yutasu, the civilization must have a stronger and more precise will. When the time comes, you will understand. For this plan to succeed, the sacrifice of Vindale was required.

Then you are the true King of Zanan? ...Interesting. But that doesn't answer my question.

A single girl was the trigger of everything. A light rain was falling in Altiheit, scattering the streetlight as it fell to the earth. A group of people surrounded and gazed cruelly at a young Elean girl, and a beautiful blonde young man protected her without hesitation. From that moment, he was like her brother... That event became Saimore's hope, and the White Hawk became the target of his admiration.

{chat_4}
Elishe...

{chat_1}
Saimore wished for the two of you to live a happy life... And so he helped. You should know well that, even in a merit-based society like Zanan, without some sort of connection it's difficult to realize the dream of become an Officer of the Imperial Court while associating with an Elean girl.

We will warn the people of the Forest. They may not have even realized the threat creeping towards them. After that, I don't know. Having our home destroyed is painful, yet part of me believes they should do as they damn well please. Those who took part in the Forest's destruction and those who stood on the sidelines and allowed it will realize with despair what they have wrought. But Larnneire... What do you think?

He is no longer here, nor do I know where he has gone. I have taken command. And unfortunately for you, I have no intention of negotiating.

I know it's too late to stop the flames. But please, stop attacking the Elea who are escaping the Forest. They don't even have weapons with which to resist.

Let go of my arm, Bethel. It's precisely because of this situation that I must go. I must show that even for those who can't understand each other, you can't abandon the idea that possibilities exist beyond a simple wall of hatred and distrust.

{chat_4}
I am begging you... Please, Larnneire, don't go. If you enter the Forest, I won't be able to follow you. I won't be able to protect you. Will you once again carve the pain of that day into my heart?

{chat_2}
If I abandon them here then I have betrayed myself, as well as the Elishe that you loved. I know that it cannot be only sorrow that she brought you. Goodbye, White Hawk of Altiheit. No matter how many tears you shed from the pain of the wounds upon your wings, I pray that the day will come that you will be able to fly once more.

{txt}
The Vindale Forest was lost.
 
Though the people who heard the
news praised the Prince of Zanan,
the world gradually began to change.

{txt}
Unknown illnesses began to spread,
crops withered, and dry winds raged.
 
By the time people began to notice these
strange occurrences, Barius of Zanan had a
female Elea, a survivor of the war, standing
witness before the Imperial Court.
 
{txt}
The woman told the world the truth.
 
The Vindale Forest, which people had
referred to as the Heretical Forest, had
been suppressing the power of the Meshera.
 
And with the destruction of the
Forest, Irva would soon change to
become uninhabitable by all peoples.

{txt}
The people of Irva were taken aback by this testimony.
 
Some were heartbroken, others
filled with regret, and as always,
others cared not at all.
 
Dark times had come to Sierre Terre.

{txt}
But not all hope was lost.
 
It was as Barius said. Another Heretical Forest
was left in Irva. Strangely, it was something
that Saimore had created for research when
still the Second Prince of Zanan.

The country of Zanan which had led the attack on Vindale split,
and the community of Rosuria, ruled by Barius, was born.
 
Rosuria would cultivate the Forest, promote
peace, and without regard for borders allow
people to visit the Forest and be cured of
their disease.

{txt}
The promised land of Rosuria was expected
to become the utopia of Irva.

{txt}
-Three Years Later-

{txt}
You have wandered from country to country, and
like the first time you visited North Tyris, have
slipped upon a merchant ship headed for Port Kapul.

{txt}
Three years have brought many changes.
 
The scars left on Irva are deep. Although
the sadness may never be overcome, over
time, the towns regained their bustle
and the people have forgotten the nightmare,
or at least behave as if they have.

{txt}
Rosuria has become corrupted.
 
With the salvation they offered, Rosuria attracted
great wealth as well as the interest of many countries
like Yerles, and Rosuria was left at their mercy.
 
Even with the world headed towards destruction,
Irva could not be united under Rosuria. With
each country plotting and planning, new dark
clouds of dispute have begun to cover Irva.

{txt}
And now, your journey into the shadow of
confusion covering Irva is about to begin.

{txt}
You spent a great deal of time deciphering the
writing of truth discovered in Lesimas, and
discovered that between the era of Rehm-Ido
and the previous civilization an unknown era
known as Naku Domara existed.
 
It was in this time that Chaos and magic were brought
to Irva, as well as the time that holds the keys to
the mysterious civilization of Nefia.

{txt}
As you land in Port Kapul, the nostalgic cool
winds of North Tyris brush against your face.
You take a step forward.
 
{txt}
In your future, a wondrous yet difficult
adventure concerning the Eternal League
of Nefia awaits.

How long has it been since the Heretical Forest was burned?
While most people continue their lives as normal, averting their eyes
from the fact that the world is headed towards inevitable destruction,
the situation of the counties of the world has changed.
 
{txt}
Barius, the ruler of Rosuria, has been overthrown. His
commitment to the stance of an independent and neutral Rosuria
was nothing but a thorn in the sides of the other nations.
When his previously concealed connection with Saimore was brought
to light by spies from other countries, he quickly lost his standing.
 
Many of the Elea have abandoned Rosuria after its fall
and have spread across the world as refugees.
After having been persecuted for so long and losing their
homes, radical sentiment among the Elea is on the rise.
It's only a matter of time before rioting begins across all of Irva.

{txt}
At the same time, a war has kicked off between the
Yerles and Eulderna in South Tyris.
While their goals are unknown, their hostility
and antagonism towards Juere has also drawn them
into the fray, creating a three-way conflict.

You can't control your heart's pounding as you step
foot into the chaotic South Tyris.

Meanwhile, in an Elean village.

{txt}
The Elea had scattered throughout the world.
In one village, a speech was just beginning.
 
In the center of the crowd stands a single young Elea.

{chat_1}
Take a look at what has become of Irva! The people have turned their eyes from the future they know is to come, spending their days only trying to forget! We Elea know the bitter taste of sadness, anger, and despair! But they forget what they have done to us! Will we allow their treatment to go unpunished? Nay, I say! We will not!

{chat_1}
Now is the time for action... Those of you who say our revenge will bear no fruit, I want you to think again. What we do is for the sake of the future. Already we have nothing left but pain. We must be united. Only by returning the people's consciousness and confronting this calamity can our fallen brothers and sisters rest in peace.

{chat_1}
We will take on the role of the despised once more. But this time not by the plotting of Saimore, but of our own will! Rise, my brothers! For the sake of this world! Only we who know so much pain may open the doors to the future!

{txt}
The majority of the village rose to action after the speech.
Upon hearing the news, many Elea from
other villages joined the uprising, and the
power of the extremists was increasing every day.
 
As the extremists grew in number, order was gradually
decreasing, leading to looting and mob behavior.
The status of the Elea continued to fall...

Any last words, albino Prince of Zanan?

{chat_3}
Prior to destroying the Forest... I felt that I could be satisfied by leaving a scar upon Irva. And yet somehow the reality has turned out like this.

{chat_3}
A certain Elean girl left a spark of light in my heart... And after leaving Zanan to live normally while hiding my identity, I became burdened by an ever increasing sense of guilt.

{chat_3}
And so once again I set out to investigate the Meshera. Perhaps I wished to atone for my sins. Regardless, I made a discovery and cannot allow myself to die before entrusting another with this information. There is an ancient ruin in South Tyris... That is where the Meshera were born. Irva's hope lies within its deepest reaches.

...Then I'll give you a simple rundown of the plan.

{chat_5}
The target of this operation is the Plant. Since it's an obstacle to our investigation into the deepest areas of the ruin, we'll exterminate it. As we've learned from the data we have, the Plant attacks by spreading spores onto its targets without even moving from its spot, and manipulates those it has absorbed.

{chat_5}
Therefore the difficult to absorb mechanized units will take the front, and an optical barrier will be deployed for defense. Our soldiers will be firing an unending barrage of ether bullets from the rear. This is certain to cause some damage to the monster.

{chat_5}
Upon confirmation that the Plant has ceased action in order to revive itself, the mechanized units will fall back and the Yerleswood Mk2 will advance. After completely destroying the Plant through the Ether Blaster in the Yerleswood's chest, the entire bottom floor will be sterilized via Ether. This will conclude the operation.

{chat_4}
I see. So what are you expecting from us then?

{chat_5}
We'd like for you all to take action with our 7th Special Forces team. Your two Elean companions will be in charge of carrying the Ether we'll use for sterilization, while the remaining two will be in the rear guard.

{chat_2}
We agreed to cooperate with your study on the nullification of the Meshera the other day. We'd be glad to cooperate in this strategy as well.

{chat_3}
I don't mind cooperating, but... You want us to carry the Ether since Elea are more resistant to its corruption, right? Being an Elea is rough.

{chat_5}
We wanted to use the right people for the right tasks. We're presently making the final adjustments to our equipment that we need for this operation. Once these adjustments are finished we'll be departing, so be ready to leave at any time.

<The world continues to turn>

{txt}
You hid the fact that you possessed the Origin of Vice
from Larnneire's entourage and the Yerles army.
Initially they were wary of your uncanny familiarity
with the technology of the ancient civilizations...

{txt}
But recognizing you as an accomplished adventurer,
they eventually dropped their suspicions. Through the combined
power of your knowledge, the science of the Yerles,
and the remaining data from the bottom of Remido, the
study of the Meshera advanced at a remarkable pace.

{txt}
Beaten to the punch by the Yerles, the Eulderna
military withdrew from Juere's territory.
The three-sided war came to a close. South Tyris
changed from a place mired in the chaos of a fullscale
war to an area that rarely even saw skirmishes.

An artificial bacteria which got out of control
and became far more harmful than before...
That was the true nature of the Meshera.
Together with the scientists of Yerles, you
were able to revive the original Meshera strain,
raise its tolerance to mutating out of control,
and incorporate the ability to destroy the Meshera.

{txt}
After many tests to verify its safety and potency,
this new artificial bacteria was unleashed on the world.
Though it will take an extraordinary amount of time for
the Meshera to be eliminated from Irva, it is certain
that as its hold weakens, the Etherwind too
will become less potent.

{txt}
Having declined the Yerles' attempt at scouting you and
left Melugas, you parted from Larnneire who left to
revive Vindale and began a new adventure.
 
You believe that now, at some point in the future,
that the threat of the Meshera will disappear from Irva...

The fatigue from your journey seems to
have gotten the best of you, and you slowly fall
asleep while being rocked around with the
cargo on a merchant's wagon heading towards
Lumiest. Some time later, you are awoken
from your slumber by the sounds of the
guards. The wagon has stopped for a break.

Still not fully awakened from your dreams, you listen to
the conversation between the familiar voices.
 
{chat_1}
...Really? I don't know anything myself, but this is what I've heard from other mercenaries...

It was about a month ago, I think. Heard it from one of the mercs that were hired by Kikkas for their fight with Nieca.

Kikkas, huh.

...? Anyways, it happened one night when he was on guard duty.

{chat_1}
He got a strange feeling all of a sudden, and when he looked towards the enemy camp, he saw a dazzling pillar of light stretching towards the sky. Thinking it must be some type of attack magic - a new weapon or something - he went and woke up the rest of the camp. He...

Just then, the break ended and the wagon began
to move again. The two men's conversation continued,
but their voices slowly faded until you could no
longer hear them.

You intended to hop off the wagon just past the border,
but you can't hold out against your sleepiness any longer.

There were no need for additional adjustments. Besides, isn't a real-world test better than a rehearsed performance?

Umm... Why are you referring to it as "Melugast"? I thought its name was the D-3...

Oh don't be so formal, Milis. "D-3" doesn't roll off the tongue well, so Melugast is the nickname I gave it. A "gust" of wind from Melugas. How's that?

I think I will write a book. There are other Elea living in small villages around the world just like us.

All of the testimonies we've received are almost identical. There's still a lot that I don't understand though. Who is the one that summoned them to Lost Irva in the first place? Some of the people mention hearing the voice of "Tezcatlipoca", the god that is said to have gone on a rampage and started the War of the Gods. Even if we assume that it is Tezcatlipoca that's doing the summoning, what purpose is there behind it...?

I do. The continent of Tyris contains many ruins of Nefia. Adventurers come here from all over the world.

A voice suddenly resonates within your mind as you are walking.
Despite your surprise, you listen intently to the faint voice...

{chat_1}
I'm sure someone out there will be able to hear this. My ancestor that had been slumbering for tens of thousands of years has recently begun to awaken. Because of that, our castle has risen to the surface... The psychic waves emitted by my ancestor have driven the people of the surrounding islands insane. The closer he comes to fully awakening, the further the psychic waves spread. Eventually they will engulf the world.

{chat_1}
I... I do not wish for such a thing to happen... I have heard that a powerful warrior exists somewhere here on the surface. If anyone hears this, please, convey this message to them. I want you to stop my ancestor. I am ashamed I cannot handle this myself... Please. I have prepared for a tortoise to take you to my castle from the coastal town of Valm...

The negotiations with <Garziem> the Iron Horseman were successful. Using the equipment capable of protecting adventurers from supersonic speeds, a massive reduction in travel time is now possible. By utilizing the transportation hubs in each country that have remained hidden until now, anywhere should be accessible within a day. All of the information is written here, so you should distribute the devices after assessing the aptitude of the adventurers.

{chat_3}
Hoh... By being able to dispatch adventurers quickly all across the world, we should be able to get the situation under control. I'll try it out right away. I apologize for requesting something this large so suddenly.

{chat_1}
Please, it was nothing. I'll be heading off. Let me know if there needs to be any changes to the plans.

Erystia... Mmmgh?! W-Was that the Tour Planner you requested help from that just ran out of here? The girl has some legs on her, I'll give her that.

{chat_3}
She literally runs everywhere around the world to make her tour plans. What do you expect? Anyways, how was the meeting with Zanan and the Yerles?

{chat_2}
Ah, well, the armies of Chaos are still running wild. I'm worried that these two countries may fall if the onslaught continues. I think it will be necessary after all to take the Cradle of Chaos on Lost Irva.

{chat_3}
But the White Hawk just recently mentioned in a report that it's impossible to continue further into the Cradle of Chaos due to a strong magical boundary, right?

{chat_2}
Indeed. Supposedly the Yerles have a way to deal with that. They're going to start preparations for it now. Oh yes, and there were two requests from Zanan. The first is the extermination of a biological weapon that accidentally got out of control. You can look at the documents on that later. The second is a personal request from one of the Zanan officers... When the White Hawk reports in again, the officer wants you to hand him this letter.

{chat_3}
I'll deal with both of them. Well, the first one will be dangerous, so we'll need an adventurer. I'll think about it and send someone suitable. The latter really is just personal business, but I don't mind if its just handing over a letter.

You're finally back. Did you manage to find out anything?

{chat_1}
I heard from a passing adventurer that it's recently become possible to travel back and forth between North Tyris and the floating continent from some mountain. The airships of the Eulderna capital all appear to be out in combat with the demons or patrolling. I think we should head for North Tyris.

{chat_3}
What? We came all the way out here for nothing? Who was it again? The one saying that Bethel just HAS to be on the floating continent, so we should take one of Eulderna's airships?

What other choice did we have?! At the time we left, that was the only way that seemed feasible! I want to get to Bethel as soon as I can! Oh Bethel, we'll just be a little longer... By the way, where is Larnneire? Is she not back from gathering food?

I'm glad you seem to be okay. When I first saw you, I thought it might already be too late. I found you with serious injuries next to the river. It's fortunate that someone like us with healing abilities found you before night fell.

Oh, he's awake... You really do look familiar. I wonder where I saw you before.

I'm sorry for causing you trouble. My name is Hali... Harry. I've been visiting Elean villages looking for a friend, but after being attacked by a demon, fell into the river and got carried away by the current.

Harry...? Ah. Hmm...

I'm Larnneire. We're on a trip looking for our friend as well. We just found out about a hitch in our original plan and have changed our destination. I hope we both find the people we are searching for.

{chat_3}
Harry - or whatever your name is - I've got a bit of bad news. From what I've heard, there's an Elean village in Niesa past the southwest mountains. However, a demon of vengeance has been attacking the towns of Niesa recently, and chaos spirits have become more active as well. If you're going to head for that village, you'll have to be very careful.

I'm sure it will be tough, but do your best. No matter what happened in the past, everyone has to keep moving forward.

This last Servant is quite the problem, isn't it? Even after we freed it, it simply bound itself to the ruin of Nefia instead of going to work. I mean, I know it's supposed to be the demon of binding, but I didn't except it to bind itself.

We're closing in on the Eternal Seal. As an Apostle, perhaps he was influenced by being so close to his god.

Ah, I see... Huh? I think this is the first time we've been able to speak alone. There's always been the three of us since you joined.

{chat_2}
You know, you're right. I've never gotten the chance to ask why you're aiming for the Eternal Seal alongside Master Orphe. But I'd like to understand your circumstances, as a like-minded comrade.

{chat_3}
Fair enough. I'm from House Bellum in Eulderna. I was driven out.

{chat_2}
House Bellum. Ah, even an ignorant man like me knows that name. If I'm not mistaken, they're a distinguished family of wizards... Why were you driven out?

{chat_3}
Indeed they are. I developed a type of magic to manipulate humans, but it was never recognized as official magic. The examiner found it difficult, and proclaimed it to be a complete bastardization of domination magic. That's despite the fact that the magical structure is completely different. Even my younger sister could realize its superior potential.

{chat_3}
I found it strange that he couldn't recognize it, seeing as he was a senior wizard that had once been quite cozy with the Court. I did keep requesting re-examination, of course. But this continued many times, and soon people began to call me the shame of House Bellum. Nasty and untrue rumors began to spread. My parents, worried about appearances, severed their ties with me. I just...! This kind of rotten world...!

{chat_2}
...This is a long story, isn't it? Here, I've made some tea. Have a drink.

{chat_3}
Oh. What was this made with?

{chat_2}
It's made using precious tea leaves from Rosuria. I've put in a little extra sugar for you, since it's the style in Rosuria to drink it all in one gulp.

{chat_3}
I'll try it... So sweet! The sugar didn't finish dissolving though, so it was a bit coarse. Let's see. Right, after being thrown out with no place to go, I became an adventurer. With my "disappointing" magic, I didn't have any problems making money. I roamed about all over the world. But no matter how famous I became, I wasn't satisfied.

{chat_2}
You have my sympathy.

{chat_3}
Then one day, I found myself wrapped in light and brought to Lost Irva... Ugh... Keh... Wh... What is this!

Since your magic might be a hindrance when I go to take care of "him", I've been waiting for my chance to act. You also planned to use your persuasion, didn't you? Since I'd find it troubling to throw the world into a crisis over a personal grudge, I put Ether powder in that tea. "High Purity" Ether that was found in South Tyris, at that.

At least while all of this is going on, the countries can put aside their quarrels for a while...

All the mortals are aiming for the Seal... Even more than I expected, but even so, I'm still worried.

This little pilgrimage is nothing compared to a life on the run. I don't think this will absolve me of my sins, but I want to be of at least some use. When I hear of someone investigating the Meshera, I can't just stay silent.

It's heartening to hear you say that. It's nice that Yerles began investigating an improved Meshera at the behest of Palmia, but to be frank, it's not really their specialty.

{chat_2}
Duke Sevilis, I want you know something... My brother Clyne is said to have died in a terrible accident. But the truth is... I killed him. At a cliff just like this one. He was looking over the edge, and with my hand I just...

{chat_1}
...

{chat_2}
Haha, even the cold-hearted shadow of Derphy is at a loss for words when faced with someone who committed fratricide.

{chat_2}
...As he began to fall, my older brother's eyes opened with surprise. It's only because he hadn't even taken the first precaution that I was able to approach him from behind. By the time he realized what was happening, nothing could be done.

{chat_2}
Even now I dream of that moment when I pushed my brother over the ledge. At the time I felt powerful in the thought that I had triumphed over my brother, but now I can only think of how foolish I was.

...

{chat_1}
...This isn't the time or place for lament.

{chat_1}
(At last he's admitted it. But I must say, even I find it to be pitiable. I wasn't aware that Saimore had been driven into such a corner by an inferiority complex; I only cared for my own appearances.)

(Oh, I certainly showed him some degree of compassion. But more than anything, inwardly, I looked at my useless brother with contempt. And Saimore was able to sense that...)

{chat_2}
You're right. It's pointless to dwell on. It's not an act that can be forgiven just by confessing. The only man with the right to forgive me is no longer in this world...

{chat_1}
Let me say this, Saimore. You're not the only person in the world that regrets his past. Don't forget that. If you let the past hang over you, it will crush you someday. You need to continue moving forward. That is my only request.

So you've come. I've been expecting you. You are the closest mortal to the Eternal Seal, after all.

{chat_2}
I've only been descending without fighting. When it comes to combat, there are many stronger than I.

{chat_1}
Hmm... But your power is enough for you to be the decisive factor.

{chat_2}
A moment ago, you said that I was the "closest mortal" to the Eternal Seal... But there are many humans, monsters, and machines within the Cradle of Chaos. Haven't many of them already passed the floor I have?

{chat_1}
Indeed, but as they cannot fulfill the role we require, I've excluded them. Those who have been defeated by a trial of Nefia were only summoned as a defense mechanism, you see. The Cradle of Chaos is connected to all the ruins of Nefia through the Mirage Tower.

{chat_2}
Trial of Nefia...?

{chat_1}
It is what you may know as Nefia Syndrome. It's a screening process, a way to finding mortals capable of maintaining a normal mental state even when being affected by the mind of a god. It was tough to come up with, let me tell you.

{pic}	"bg6"
{mc}	"mcDungeon10"

{chat_2}
Wait. Nefia Syndrome is just a trial to select people...?! And those that fail are being used as a defense mechanism? What the hell is all this?

{chat_1}
Hmm...? Do you think this is bad? I think it's a perfectly effective way to make use of mortals with no other purpose. Besides, one can hardly expect diving into ruins of Nefia in the search of treasure to be safe. They brought it upon themselves.

{chat_2}
Just how many people have been sacrificed since this "trial" began...? It doesn't matter. It's already far too many.

{chat_2}
...So what the hell are you talking about when you say "decisive factor"? I understand it's someone that requires what is needed for the battle with the God of Chaos, but some specifics would be nice.

Tsk tsk tsk! So naive, Larnneire! The most basic rule of exploring ruins of Nefia is to make frequent trips back to the surface. There's not a single adventurer that would venture more than 10 floors without returning.

After the War of the Gods, the name of the Gods has been unchanging, but there have been successors. The gods are gods, and are bound by oath... But those who want to be free to travel, who are tired of the work, or have fallen in love with a mortal... They have left for a variety of reasons.

The successors... The most capable avatar, mortals with outstanding capabilities, or even a hand-crafted vessel... They take over the name, and thus the power.

To be honest, we don't even know ourselves how many generations there have been. Or age. Ah, but I believe Itzpalt is only the second successor since the War of the Gods.

..."Crisis in a long-term perspective" like Meshera was ineffective. If you continue, "easy-to-understand threat" exists as forces of chaos, but I thought Yutasu can be suppressed. Let's think about another plan.

You seem to have heard from other gods a lot. Your movement has been marked.

Really. Nefia's eternal covenant... If it goes against Elona you have no choice. But, that core part. I have almost no idea.

{chat_2}
There is not it. I can know everything that happened outside of gods who does not understand divine power. You ought not to have information that is close to the core.


{mc}	"mcOpening"

{chat_1}
Once upon a time, after the majority of human race has left the star. The gods began a fierce battle to secure their faith in themselves. Tens of thousands of gods were destroyed in the battle, thousands of new gods were born, power relationships changed dramatically. The world is truly God Warring States period.

{chat_2}
That is what I talked about before. (God Warring States Period?)

{chat_1}
But behind it was a chaotic god who had been forced to fight to the conflict. The chaotic god scoured the injured gods one after another and took it one after another and was putting the power enough to defeat the god god class one by one. The gods who noticed it stopped fighting, boarded the ship and challenged the battle of the bottom of the bottom.

{chat_2}
Noticed I mean, I though he has been a declaration of war from the other side.

{chat_1}
Spirits of the entourage aside, god of chaos was mighty. The gods did not win even hit the decent, I decided to impress upon him to it to create a space to break the divine power. Many gods became companions to fit in a trap, but the gods who managed to seal the chaotic god made a castle on it. And it did not destroy all the 24 angels who went to chaos, sealed the castle as punishment.

{chat_2}
There are 72 angels who rolled over in all. There were only 24 bodies that were not dead.

{chat_1}
The gods lifted the continent into the sky with the aim of monitoring the chaos of the chaos and isolating the mana and climate disturbed areas in the war. Thus one continent was lost from Irva. The power taken away from the chaotic god was gradually reduced to the world via the tower, and in the process the artifacts overflowed to the world.

{chat_1}
After that, it was supposed to wait for weakness until we were able to beat even a few gods who survived. However, the chaotic god who had stored more power than expected had thousands or even tens of thousands of years old, but the force did not run out and the confined space... The gap between the gods became obsolete and the limit came. If it causes a malfunction, it will be tough. So, we decided to create a new god that was one size larger around the outside, but it turned out that the chaotic god woke up while switching.

{chat_1}
Those who attract the attention of the chaotic god are needed during switching, but there is a danger that if god tries to do it god or chaos god deprived of divine power and disappear. After such a dilemma, in the early days of Naku Domara, the strongest military force of the time of the time was chosen as a deciding corps.

{chat_2}
People are bad about death squads. One person was helped properly... Yeah. I was able to help but...

{chat_1}
...The gods who are keenly aware of the lack of power of mortality have greatly increased the amount of divine force release to the world, thinking that it is not easy for the next time. Chaos and magical powers were brought to the world, Nefia was formed, the lives of the mortals changed completely. But those who drowned in power caused a magical war, and Naku Domara was destroyed.

{chat_2}
That was a little hasty. But becomes hindsight, we should have been going to break little by little until it is able to govern the use of force in their own...

{chat_1}
Then after a while biochemistry civilization. The gods who need switching work also recruit war potential. As a result, the strongest synthetic beast was made by artificial bacteria called Mesaia, and played a role in exchange for that. But the gods who thought that power was dangerous made Mesaia runaway and Rehm-Ido was destroyed.

{chat_2}
Wrong! Mesaia has runaway is a complete accident! We have been forced to deal with hundreds of years so that mortality is not annihilated, not involving!

{chat_1}
And this time we need to switch again. What kind of sacrifice will come this time? The answer is not known even the gods.

{chat_2}
That is also different. It is considerably debilitating to see the amount released. Mortal physical ability and technical levels were also improved as much as now beyond recognition. In theory, it should be suppressed this time. It is a genuine decisive battle that breaks the fate that has passed through many generations.

{chat_1}
Hmm. ...But can you truly be suppressed? The identity of the chaotic god is your parent, is not it?

{chat_2}
Parent??? My?

{chat_2}
You seem to misunderstand me. That guy is mine... what I'm telling you!?

Strategy of annihilation of chaotic spirits? In each country joint?

{chat_2}
That's it. Everyone, look at the material at hand.

{chat_3}
"The spirits of chaotic inhabitants who have grown enough and gathered together are gathered in one place to coalesce and proliferate. It has already been confirmed that more than 30,000 have already gathered in the mountainous region of Rosuria." ...Recently, when thinking that it is decreasing, did such a thing happen?

{chat_1}
Nevermind that... If there are so many numbers, it is difficult to make a one-shot. And it's just between the capital of Rosuria and the harbor. I can not let the gravity bomb drop. Even if you are going to roast with a normal attack, if the target is to scatter around it, it is a catastrophe.

{chat_2}
That's it. Look at Figure 2 and it is the expected combat area. To be honest, it is too wide. Even if you compete with skilled adventurers and Yerleswood you can not cover it at all.

{chat_3}
So the joint strategy with the fighting force from each country. The story line goes through. It is about if this observation data cited by Rosuria is true. Because there was also a previous incident that other than Yerles cheated and attacked the Heretical Forest.

{chat_2}
As a precaution, I shot with my home country satellite is Figure 3.

{chat_4}
What is this infinite number of red spots... Wow. Their eyes are shining, I feel bad!

{chat_1}
Shogun, sort of good. In this plan, we will have a frontal base near the capital of Rosuria and a Melugast transition site will be built there.

{chat_2}
Oh. With dimensional distortion navigation, labor and time to transport fighting force from each country can be greatly saved. Because day trips are also possible, excellent talent can be easily pulled.

{chat_1}
However, it is only the core part to build. Certainly it is possible with this schedule only for this core, but it is impossible to operate unless a large-scale energy supply facility is also built. Does the man who wrote this plan understand there?

{chat_2}
It is anxious. I asked the staff headquarters. ...Anything, it seems to use a mobile magical battery developed recently in Eulderna. That name is Mana Monolith. It seems that there are certain specs that you can take to the operating line.

{chat_1}
Was Eulderna developing such a thing? But to be combined with the enemy's technology... It will be a complex feeling over there.

After a month of rain finished
the forest changed appearance.
The woods were covered in a mist of mysterious light
that caused the forest to rapidly spread
and destroyed the mind of anyone trapped in it.
Creatures in the forest became violent and hit the outside tribes.
 
This incident, which started from the eastern continent
soon spread into the land of Aimwell
and many refugees flowed into North Tyris.
 
Dole's young prince Omuzu preached
that this is the misery "Meshera" that destroyed the former civilization.
He appealed the need for the elimination of the Heretical Forest and the people of Erusia.
Many people favored him and felt the time of warfare approaching.
 
The people of Erusia eventually moved away from human land,
but this only postponed the confrontation.
The operation of sweeping by Dole was about to begin even now.

beasts erupted at the frontier and grew explosively.

After several countries have disappeared beyond oblivion,
only the absence has spread.
For those eaten by the beast,
those who were left could not remember anything.

エレアを弾圧し、森を焼いてしまった事実と罪悪感を民衆に忘れさせてはいけない。彼が静かに後世に伝えていく限りなら…むしろ都合がいい。

{chat_1}
（ここまで本当に長かった。思い返せば上手くいかないことの連続だった）

{chat_1}
（この時代に目覚め、イェルスのデータベースをハッキングし、技術者として潜り込むまでは割と順調だった）

{chat_1}
（しかし俺の最終目標物はコンセプトが軍隊にそぐわず、戦力としてもあまりに過剰。案の定、そのままの仕様では予算がつかなかった）

{chat_1}
（おかげで機能を分割して企画を通すことになったが、これが苦労の始まりだったな。本来ひとつの物をわざわざ分離してデザインし直し、合体機構を秘密裏に内蔵し、専用の合体プログラムを構築…予算さえ得られればこんな面倒くさい真似はしなくてよかったんだ）

{chat_1}
（せっかく作ったイェルスード１号機は警備部隊長の教育が悪かったのか脱走するし、０号機と３号機は本国の手違いで次元の狭間にふっ飛ばされた。メルガストの方も現存する部品ではスペックが足りず、やむなく魔物の翼やら光を操るアンクやらを研究する手間も生じた）

{chat_1}
（なんとか乗り越えてここまで来たが、混沌の神とやらのせいでメルガストは今浮遊大陸に釘付けになっている。全オプション実装試験という名目は達成済みな以上、２機目を新造する予算なんてつかないだろう）

{chat_1}
（メルガストの所へネオを差し向けるよう進言したが、防衛上の理由で却下されたからな。くそ、誰かが混沌の神を始末してくれればいいんだが。早く助手に俺の集大成を見せてやりたい…）

今頃は各国にＬＦ計画の提案が届いている頃よ。

なるほどな。ヴァリウスの思想は、良くも悪くも相変わらずといったところか。わかった。報酬はいつもの部下から受け取ってくれ。

{chat_3}
オッケー。じゃあ続報を仕入れたら教えてあげるわ。

{chat_1}
頼んだぞ。

またあの情報屋か…どこからでも突然現れるな、奴は。

{chat_1}
そのせいですっかり話が逸れてしまったな。それでサイモア、何か用があったんじゃないか。

{chat_2}
そうだ。委託されているメシェーラ観測調査についてなのだが。私が昔使っていた調査方式と器具を追加するよう提案したい。現在イェルスから提供されているものと比べて、ほとんど手間を増やさずに詳細な測定が可能になる。

{chat_2}
今後、調査項目が増えても柔軟に対応ができるようにもなる。というより影響を観測する目的ならば、最低でも項目を3つほど増やしたほうがいい。文書にまとめておくから、調査本部に提案しておいてくれないだろうか。

驚いた。子供の頃から災厄の研究をしてきただけのことはある。もし皇位を継承しなければ、研究者として大成する未来もあったのだろうな…。

{chat_2}
（いや…。セビリス公にならば話していてもおかしくないな。もしくはラーネイレから聞いた可能性もある）

{chat_2}
あの時の私がそのまま研究を続けていても、その成果をろくなことに使わなかっただろう。…それでも常闇の眼は惜しかったな。あれには、生化学文明当時の研究情報も記されていたというじゃないか。是非この目で一度見ておきたかった。

{chat_1}
（昔から熱心に打ち込めるものを持つ、お前が羨ましかった。それがたとえ私への反発心から始まったものだとしても。私には何も無かったからな。お前がエレアの娘と白き鷹に見出した希望のようなものですら、何も。何も無かった…）

{chat_1}
（父や家臣たちはお前を見捨て、偉大な継承者になれとばかりに私へ過剰な教育を施した。皆の期待に応えようと、強制されるがままにこなしてはみせたが、何一つ楽しいとは思えなかった。当時のお前の目には、私が皆に愛され、狩りや社交に興じているように見えたようだがな）

{chat_1}
（「クライン皇子の事故死」から、周りの者たちは手のひらを返し、お前を継承者として称え始めた。一命をとりとめた後それを知った私には、連中がひどく醜い物にしか見えなくなったよ。もはや皇位を継承する意志も理由も失った私は、そのままザナンを出奔したんだ）

{chat_1}
（無責任だと罵られても仕方がない。結果としてお前も大きすぎる権力に歪められてしまった。それでも。それでもあの時の私は、汚れた鳥籠から逃げ出したくて堪らなかったのだ…）

私の話を聞いていなかっただろう！一体何を考えていたんだ。随分と楽しそうだったぞ。

{chat_1}
ふっ、ばれたか。それにしても…そうか。楽しそうか。はは。

{chat_2}
笑って誤魔化さないでほしいな！…まぁ、いいさ。楽しそうなセビリス公という、世にも珍しいものが見れたのだから。

{chat_1}
（昔、お前は私を光だと言っていたが、私はそんな綺麗なものじゃない。闇に紛れて生きる方が、ずっと性に合っているのさ。それを改めて実感させてくれるんだ。今のお前との生活は、な）

{chat_2}
セビリス公…私は大罪人だ。特にエレアたちには途方もない迷惑をかけた。どんなに世のために働いたところで、生きている間に愚かしい過去を清算することはできないだろう。しかし…その…なんというか。これからもよろしく頼む…。

あのような悲劇が繰り返されてはならない、と一人でも思ってくれればそれで十分。これが俺が出した結論だ。…ここまで随分と回り道をしてしまったが。

いや。君が過ごしてきた日々は、きっとその結論に至るために必要なことだったのだろう。

ええ。その気持ちがあれば、立派な本になるわ。
